README

This is about a new website that I'm trying to build. I got tired of Wordpress... doing the same types of websites over and over again, so I thought I'd give Rails a shot. I have a friend who asked me to build a website about [discount flooring pensacola fl](https://act1flooringclearance.com) and I said "why not?".

So I have a lot to learn, but I really want to do this. Thanks for this great GitHub website that allows so many cool things.
